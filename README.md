# Classification Models in Machine Learning

This repository contains a collection of various classification models implemented in Python for machine learning tasks. Each model is implemented as a separate Python script, making it easy to understand and use them individually.

## Introduction
Classification is a fundamental task in machine learning where the goal is to predict the class or category of a given input. This repository aims to provide a comprehensive set of classification models implemented in Python, showcasing different algorithms and techniques commonly used in machine learning.

The models in this repository are implemented using popular libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch. Each model script includes detailed comments and documentation to explain the underlying algorithm and provide usage examples.

## Models
-The following classification models are included in this repository:

- Logistic Regression
- k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
